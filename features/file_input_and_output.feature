Feature: Using a file and an argument as input and other file as an output
  In order to detect file's language
  Using a parameter as language coverage
  Using a file as an input
  Using a file as an output

  Scenario Outline: detect input file's language, without language coverage flag the aplication detects:

	English (en)
	French (fr)
	Spanish (es)
	Italian (it)
	German (de)
	Dutch (nl)

  With language coverage flag it detects:

	English (en)
	French (fr)
	Spanish (es)
	Italian (it)
	German (de)
	Dutch (nl)
	Portugese (pt)
	Swedish (sv)
	Norwegian (no)
	Danish (da)

    Given a parameter as language coverage "<language_coverage>"
    Given the fixture file "<input_file>"
    And I put them through the kernel
    Then the output should match the fixture "<output_file>"
  Examples:
    | language_coverage	| input_file	| output_file		|
    |			| english.txt	| english_result.txt	|
    |			| spanish.txt	| spanish_result.txt	|
    |			| french.txt	| french_result.txt	|
    |			| german.txt	| german_result.txt	|
